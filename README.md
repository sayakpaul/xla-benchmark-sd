# XLA compilation of Stable Diffusion in TensorFlow

This repository provides code to serialize the different models involved in Stable Diffusion as SavedModels and to compile them with XLA. As result of the XLA-compiled concrete functions, we can obtain a good amount of speedup in the inference process.

We use the Stable Diffusion model [shipped](https://keras.io/guides/keras_cv/generate_images_with_stable_diffusion/) from KerasCV.
